      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Military Operations Research Society (MORS) is honored to offer our second annual Emerging Techniques Forum (ETF) from December 5-6, 2017 at the Hilton Mark Center in Alexandria, VA. This ETF event provides analytical practitioners, theorists, teachers and students from both outside and inside the military analytical community with an opportunity to share innovative methods from operations research, data science, advanced analytics, etc. with the objective of exposing and stretching MORSâ€™ national security and homeland defense community to emerging/cutting edge techniques. Moreover, the MORS ETF event will be an interactive, two-day forum featuring recognized expert keynote speakers, expert panels, technical papers, networking, and demonstrations.

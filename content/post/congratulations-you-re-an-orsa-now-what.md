Now that you've signed your letter stating your intent to transfer into FA49, it's natural to wonder what you need to do now. 

## Prepare either for Advanced Civil Schooling or the ORSA Military Applications Course (ORSA-MAC)

We wrote [a post]({{< ref "post/so-you-want-to-be-an-orsa.md" >}}) detailing what to do if you need to refresh your fundamental math skills. The same advice applies. A couple of other considerations you need to know is that if you received acceptance for VTIP in the first quarter (Usually August - September), then you will have a short window to apply for ACS and gain acceptance to a civilian institution of study. The reason for this is that the VTIP results usually come out in early December and you will have very little time to meet the application deadlines for various graduate schools. The bottom line is plan early and keep this in mind when you apply for VTIP during the first quarter of the fiscal year, especially when scheduling your GRE.  If you apply during the third quarter board (usually February - March), then you have time to get your academic and other requirements in order before the next ACS panel.

## Join our milBook group

Our [milBook](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/fa49-orsa) group is our primary method of communicating with the current ORSA community. Once you join the group, just follow us through connection streams, emails, and inbox watches.

## Learn about your potential first assignment on our assignments wiki

We just developed [a wiki page](https://www.milsuite.mil/wiki/FA49_Assignments_Info) that allows ORSAs to add any pertinent detail about their current assignment to help others with their assignment considerations and PCS preparations.


These are just a couple things to think about. The majority of the questions you will have about your first assignment will be handled through the assignment officer, but the propoenent office is also available to help and advice.

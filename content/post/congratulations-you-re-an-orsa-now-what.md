Now that you've signed your letter stating your intent to transfer into FA49, it's natural to wonder what you need to do now. 

## Prepare either for Advanced Civil Schooling or the ORSA Military Applications Course (ORSA-MAC)

We wrote [a post]({{< ref "post/so-you-want-to-be-an-orsa.md" >}}) detailing what to do if you need to refresh your fundamental math skills. That same advice applies to you since its been about seven years or more from the time you last studied math in a college setting. 

## Join our milBook group

Our [milBook](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/fa49-orsa) group is our primary method of communicating with the current ORSA community. Once you join the group, just follow us through connection streams, emails, and inbox watches.

## Learn about your potential first assignment on our assignments wiki

We just developed [a wiki page](https://www.milsuite.mil/wiki/FA49_Assignments_Info) that allows ORSAs to add any pertinent detail about their current assignment to help others with their assignment considerations and PCS preparations. Use the information provided and send us feedback on how we can improve it.

##  Your first ORSA assignment

Being an ORSA is like joining a guild. We will usually assign to you one of our larger analytic organizations such as the [TRADOC Analysis Ceter](http://www.trac.army.mil/) or the [Center for Army Analysis](http://www.caa.army.mil/). You could also get an assignment to the Army staff or instruct at [West Point](www.usma.edu). The commonality with all these assignments is that these organizations have a high density of ORSAs and the senior ORSA leaders will ensure you learn the necessary skills that will not only add value to your current organization but will prepare you for your future assignments. That preparation is crucial because your next assignment could on a general officer's staff or some other unit with a low density or ORSAs that usually has no more than two ORSAs assigned to these organizations. We use the term "island ORSA" to describe these types of assignments because you will not have as many ORSA colleagues physically near you, and you will have to rely more on your previous education, training, and experience. But there is no need to worry because, there is a vast support network available to you should you ever need it; all you have to do is just reach out.


These are just a few things to think about. The majority of the questions you will have about your first assignment will be handled through the assignment officer, but the propoenent office is also available to help and advice.

When you optimize, the goal is to find the minimum or maximum quantities of a given objective function, subject to specified constraints. For the military, optimization has practical applications for multiple areas including force structure, cost analysis, human resources analysis, equipping, force rotations, logistics planning, infrastructure resilience, military intelligence, and many others. A graduate level program involving optimization usually focuses on three techniques: [linear programming](https://brilliant.org/wiki/linear-programming/), [integer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming), and [nonlinear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming). From there, you may also learn about one of the most versatile applications of optimization; [network flows and graphs](http://neddimitrov.org/teaching/networks-lecture-videos.html), and other optimization techniques.

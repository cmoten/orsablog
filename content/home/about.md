The two most asked questions we get at the FA49 Proponent office is what exactly is an ORSA and what is your day to day work life? We developed this site to answer those exact questions. 

First, let's define, in simple language, what is an ORSA? ORSA stands for Operations Research/Systems Analysis. Operations Research is the application of scientific principles to business problems and providing a quantitative basis for a business decision. Systems Analysis is the process of studying an activity or process to determine the objective question(s) to be solved and discover the appropriate technique or procedure to solve the problem. To put it another way, we use Systems Analysis to determine what question to answer and use the proper operations research technique to solve the problem.

Our goal is not only for you to know not only about who we are, but we also hope you get a better sense of how we can help you if you are assigned to a unit with an ORSA. Ideally, we want to spark an interest in those officers that want to become an ORSA by demonstrating the types of work that lays ahead with a career in FA49.
